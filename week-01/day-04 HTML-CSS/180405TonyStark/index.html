   <h1>Laták Ivett (DD)</h1>
   <h3 id="aboutme">Junior software developer</h3>
   <p>I'm a 28 years old girl from Székesfehérvár, but I've been living in Budapest for 2 years now.
       I really like the city, I graduated here (I have a paper that I am a mathematics-informatics
    high school teacher), and I can only here do my favourite hobby. It is
    <a href="https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verseny-karuta">karuta</a>. I am going to go to Japan
    next autumn, I am attending a competition in Kyoto and Wakayama.</p>
    <p>I really hope, that I can finish this course nicely. I am a very hardworking person, 
        but I am studying Japanese too, and I don't want to give up on karuta, so I have to manage all
        these things together. :)
